2D single player trading card game: 18 different cards and 36 monsters: deck building+3AIs

YuGiOhJi - the Prince of the Games is an hommage to Yu-Gi-Oh! ("king of the games"). 
It is a very small trading card game with the feature that each card consists of two monsters. 
Each card can be played in at least two different ways. 
It is recommended for players, who never played a trading card game before, because it only consists of 18 different cards, as well as for TCG veterans, who want to play a completely new deck archetype.

FEATURES:

* each card can be played in very different multiple ways
* recommended for beginners: only 18 different cards and 36 different monsters
* deck building: create/save/load your own custom deck
* deck building: you can also choose from 10 different standard decks
* deck building: If you don't like hand traps, let the computer play with the "no hand traps"-deck.
* mods: switch on/off several alternative game rules
* mods: choose with how many cards and life points you want to start with
* 3 computer opponents: challenge the defensive, the balanced or the aggressive computer opponent
* info windows: optional windows showing detailed information about each card including hints from the strategy guide 
(see Advanced Strategies and Hints.pdf)
* free to play: game + rulebook + strategy guide for free!

REQUIREMENTS:

* Java (If it doesn't work, update java.)
* 4mb disk space (almost nothing)

Version info:
This is version 1.0 of the game. Possible future versions will be updated here and may have a more challenging AI. If you spot a bug, you can report it here or on itch.io in the comments.

v1.0
uploaded 18th Jul. 2019

v1.1
20th Jul. 2019

NEW FEATURES OF VERSION 1.1:
* one minor bug fixed (Now the opponent doesn't attack with zero attack value any more.)
* one optional rule added (the "Anti Dragon Ruler" rule)

I haven't really figured out this whole branch system on GitHub yet. I simply only added the updated files for version 1.1, which are supposed to replace the old ones with the same names in the folder src/yugiohji/.
